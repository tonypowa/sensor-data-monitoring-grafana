# Temperature and humidity monitoring with Raspberry Pi and Grafana

This repo contains the code files, and the commands to run a Python app for monitoring temperature and humidity with a Raspberry Pi and Grafana.

For the full step-by-step instructions including hardware and software requirements, Raspberry Pi sensor wiring, code explanation, and overview of the tech stack needed (Python, Prometheus, Docker), see this [blog post](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/10/23/monitor-temperature-and-humidity-with-grafana-and-raspberry-pi/). 

## How to use the files

Below are the simplified steps that you need to take: 

- Step 1: Interact with your sensor, enable and export your sensor data through a port with the help of an exporter. For this part we will use Python. 

- Step 2: Scrape your sensor data with Prometheus
- Step 3: Monitor your data from Grafana

### Step 1 - Python

1. Clone this repo into your Raspberry Pi. 

    ``` git
    git clone https://github.com/tonypowa/sensor-data-monitoring-grafana.git
    ```

2. Open the console from the folder containing the cloned files.

3. Install the Python libraries in your Raspberry Pi.

    ```shell
    pip3 install Adafruit_DHT flask prometheus_client
    ```

4. Create, and run the Python script as a service.

   ``` shell
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/sensor-flask.service
   ```
    Inside, paste the following:
    
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=A service that will keep my python app running in the background
    After=multi-user.target
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    Restart=always
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path-to-python-file-/app.py
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    The important piece that we need to change is the `ExecStart` flag, which takes in the command that you want to run. The first argument is the Python path (in this example it's `python3`) and the second argument is the path to the script that needs to be executed:

   ```
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path-to-python-file-/app.py
   ```

    Reload the systemd manager.

   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
    Enable, and start our service right away.

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable sensor-flask.service --now
   ```
    Check the status of your service

   ```
   systemctl status sensor-flask.service
   ```
   
    Your Python web server should be up and running.

    If you send a request to  http://localhost:5000/metrics , or visit [http://{you-raspberry-pi-IP-address}:5000/metrics]() from another machine in your network, you should be able to see the exported metrics.

### Step 2 - Prometheus

1. Run Prometheus on Docker

We will access the host port (our Raspberry Piâ€™s port), from inside the Docker container.
Run the below command. Make sure to tell Docker the path to the prometheus.yml file.

``` shell
docker run \
  -d \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    prom/prometheus
```


### Step 3 - Monitor your data from Grafana

From your machine, access your Raspberry PI by entering the IP address into the browser address: [http://{you-raspberry-pi-IP-address}:3000]() . The Grafana login page should appear (if you [installed Grafana](https://grafana.com/tutorials/install-grafana-on-raspberry-pi/) before to this point).
